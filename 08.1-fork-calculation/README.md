# Fork and Process Completion

This program demonstrates the use of process creation and management by utilizing the fork possibilities, and process IDs. It creates a child process and then determines which of the two processes (parent or child) finishes a calculation loop first.

The program accepts an optional command-line argument that activates an additional fractal calculation within the loop.

## Usage

```bash
# Without fractal calculation
./fork-calculation

# With fractaal calculation > 2
./fork-calculation 5
```
