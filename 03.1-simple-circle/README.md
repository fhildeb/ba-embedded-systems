# Circle Calculations

This program calculates the circumference and area of a circle using a user-provided radius. It leverages the preprocessor directive to define the constant value of Pi.

The main function contains a do-while loop that repeatedly asks the user for the circle's radius, calculates the circumference and area, and increments a counter for each attempt.
