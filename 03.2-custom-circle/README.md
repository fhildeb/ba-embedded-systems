# Circle Calculations

This project calculate the circumference and area of a circle using a custom user made radius function to determine Pi.

The main circle calculation program includes a do-while loop that prompts the user for the circle's radius, calculates the circumference and area, and increments an attempt counter. The calculated circumference, area, and the number of attempts made are displayed, and the loop continues until the user enters 'n' when prompted to try again. The program exits with an 'EXIT_SUCCESS' status code.
