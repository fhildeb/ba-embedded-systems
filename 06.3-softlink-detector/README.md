# Symbolic Link Detector

This project tests whether a given file is a symbolic (soft) link or not. The tester takes a file name as an input and returns the linked file name if it is a soft link, or NULL if the file does not exist or is no soft link.

If the user provides two file names, the program checks whether the second file is a link to the first file.
