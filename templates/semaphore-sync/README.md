# Semaphore-based Process Synchronization

This program demonstrates how to use semaphores for synchronization between processes. It defines a function to initialize a semaphore with a given name and initial value, opens a semaphore and waits for permission to access a shared resource. Once permission is granted, the program writes some messages and releases the semaphore. The program can be used as a template for inter-process communication, where semaphores are used to control access to shared resources.
