# Client-Server Network Text Communication

This is a client-server communication project where the client sends text lines to the server, which converts them to uppercase and sends them back to the client for display. The client connects to the server using a socket and sends input from `stdin` to the server.

The program uses a file descriptor and various network functions:

- get host by name
- connect
- socket
- host to network
