# Socketpair Communication using Child Process

This project demonstrates the use of a socketpair for communication between a parent process and a child process running a filtering program. The parent process reads input from stdin and sends it to the child process via the socketpair, and the child process filters the input and sends the output back to the parent process via the same socketpair. The program creates the socketpair using the according system call and forks a child process to run the filter program. The parent process closes the write end of the socketpair and sends input to the child process through the socket, while the child process redirects its standard input and output to the read end of the socketpair. The parent process then reads the output from the child process via the socketpair and prints it to stdout.
