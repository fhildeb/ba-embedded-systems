# File Creation, Reading, Writing

This program demonstrates how to create a new file, write text into it, and read it using system calls. It creates a new file named 'myfile' or overwrites the existing one. After initialization or overwriting, a text is written into the file. Next, it sets the file position indicator to the beginning of the file, reads the file in 100-byte blocks, and displays them on the console until the end of the file is reached.
