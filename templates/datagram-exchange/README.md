# Client-Server Datagram Communication

The program is a simple socket-based trigonometric calculator. The project consists of a server and a client program. The server waits for client requests and calculates the requested trigonometric function (sin, cos, or tan) with the given argument. The result is then sent back to the client.

The communication between the client and server is done through Unix domain sockets. The project also includes signal handling and error checking to ensure proper functioning of the program.
